# To-Do List

A simple and functional **To-Do List application** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Description

This project is a task management application where users can add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved locally using the **localStorage API**, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page. The project focuses on practicing **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **local storage management** in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Allows users to create and add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough.
- **Delete Tasks**: Provides an option to remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage Support**: Tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, preserving them across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for a modern and clean user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for task management, event handling, and localStorage interaction.
